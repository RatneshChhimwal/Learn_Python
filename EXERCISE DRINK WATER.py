Write a python program which reminds you of drinking water every hour or two.
Your program can either beep or send desktop notifications for a specific operating system

"""


The provided program lacks efficiency in memory utilization, particularly in scenarios where periodic execution,
like every minute on a server, is involved. The continuous execution of the 'while True' loop for repeated update of current_time,
leads to constant resource consumption.
A more optimal approach would involve utilizing a scheduling mechanism or task scheduler
to trigger the notification function at specific intervals, ensuring the program runs only when needed.
This reduces the need for continuous looping and enhances memory efficiency, making it more suitable for server environments
where resource allocation is a critical consideration.
