        Note that we used 'super()' keyword for the first base class 'Employee', 
        So we did not pass the 'self' argument as the super() function takes care of passing the correct instance (self) to the parent class's method,
        Meanwhile for calling the constructor of the second parent class 'Programmer',
        We had to write the name of the class as well as pass the 'self' argument along with the attribute.

IMPORTANT:
Thanks to the Method Resolution Order (MRO), the 'show' method of the initial base class, 'Employee,' will be invoked.
If we were to rearrange the order of the two base classes in the child class definition in line-15
the 'show' method of the 'Programmer' class would take precedence."
