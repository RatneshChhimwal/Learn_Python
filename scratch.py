"""

Certainly! Here are 10 intermediate Python programming exercises that you can use for practice:

Palindrome Checker:
Write a program that checks whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

Word Count:
Create a program that takes a text input and counts the frequency of each word in the text.

Guess the Number Game:
Develop a number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it.
Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

File Manipulation:
Write a program that reads data from a file, performs some operations (e.g., filtering, transformation), and writes the results to another file.

Web Scraping:
Use a library like BeautifulSoup to scrape data from a website. Extract specific information and display it in a meaningful way.

Password Generator:
Create a program that generates a random password of a specified length with a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.

Database Interaction:
Connect to an SQLite database using Python and perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a table.

Web Development (Flask/Django):
Build a simple web application using a web framework like Flask or Django. Create a page that displays information from a database or accepts user input.

Sorting Algorithm Implementation:
Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort) and compare its performance on different sizes of input data.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Design and implement a class hierarchy for a real-world scenario.
For example, a library management system with classes for books, patrons, and transactions.

These exercises cover a range of topics, including string manipulation,
file handling, web development, database interaction, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.
Working on them will help you strengthen your Python skills and gain confidence in solving diverse problems.
