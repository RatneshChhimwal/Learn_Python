"""

Generators in Python are special type of functions that allow you to create an iterable sequence of values.
A generator function returns a generator object, which can be used to generate the values one-by-one as you iterate over it.
Generators are a powerful tool for working with large or complex data sets, as they allow you to generate the values on-the-fly,
rather than having to create and store the entire sequence in memory.

"""

def my_generator():                 # We create a function 'my_generator'
    for i in range(500):            # We define a 'for' loop to iterate till 500
      # Complex computations
      yield i                       # Rather than returning 'i' will yield 'i' one at a time

gen = my_generator()                # We call the function 'my_generator' and store the result inside 'gen'
print(next(gen))                    # We print the currently stored value for 'gen' using syntax: print(next('variable containing the value for the function call'))
# print(next(gen))
# print(next(gen))

# for j in  gen:
# print(j)


"""

Generators offer several benefits over other types of sequences, such as lists, tuples, and sets.
One of the main benefits of generators is that they allow you to generate the values on-the-fly,
rather than having to create and store the entire sequence in memory.
This makes generators a powerful tool for working with large or complex data sets, as you can generate the values as you need them,
rather than having to store them all in memory at once.

Another benefit of generators is that they are lazy, which means that the values are generated only when they are requested.
This allows you to generate the values in a more efficient and memory-friendly manner, as you don't have to generate all the values up front.
