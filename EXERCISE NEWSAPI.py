For HTTP response, the 'status_code' is a part of the response that indicates the status of the request.
A status code of 200 specifically refers to a successful HTTP request.

Mentioned below are few other status codes: ---

200 OK: The request was successful, and the server returned the requested data.

201 Created: The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result.

204 No Content: The server successfully processed the request but there is no content to send back.

400 Bad Request: The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.

404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server.

List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It consists of an expression followed by a for loop inside square brackets.
Below commented is the syntax for List comprehension:
"""
