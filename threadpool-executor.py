ThreadPoolExecutor is used in Python to manage and execute multiple threads concurrently in a pool.
Instead of creating and managing threads individually, ThreadPoolExecutor allows you to submit tasks,
and it takes care of assigning those tasks to available threads in the pool.
This helps in efficiently utilizing resources and handling multiple tasks concurrently.
It simplifies the process of parallelizing tasks and managing the execution of functions in a multithreaded environment.
