# Lambda Functions in Python:

"""
In Python, a lambda function is a small anonymous function without a name.
It is defined using the lambda keyword and has the following syntax:
"""

# SYNTAX: 'lambda arguments: expression'


""" Lambda functions are often used in situations where a small function is required for a short period of time.
They are commonly used as arguments to higher-order functions, such as map, filter, and reduce."""

# Here is an example of how to use a lambda function:

# Function to double the input

def double(x):
  return x * 2

# Lambda function to double the input

lambda x: x * 2


""" The above lambda function has the same functionality as the double function defined earlier.
However, the lambda function is anonymous, as it does not have a name."""

# Lambda functions can have multiple arguments, just like regular functions. Below is an example of a lambda function with multiple arguments:

# Function to calculate the product of two numbers

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

# Lambda function to calculate the product of two numbers
lambda x, y: x * y


# Lambda functions can also include multiple statements, but they are limited to a single expression. For example:

# Lambda function to calculate the product of two numbers,
# with an additional print statement

lambda x, y: print(f'{x} * {y} = {x * y}')


# In the above example, the lambda function includes a print statement, but it is still limited to a single expression.

"""

Lambda functions are used to write small functions which perform a basic single expression/calculation
and do not require to be 'defined' as a function having a name (anonymous),
Such as in the below example either I can define a function named 'divide_by_3' with the return statement etc,
or I can just simply write the functionality of that function as a lambda function, See below:

"""

#******************************************

#def divide_by_3(x):
    #return x/3

#print(divide_by_3(27))

# or

divide_by_3 = lambda x: x/3
print(divide_by_3(27))

#******************************************

# We can uncomment the lines from 64 to 67 and achieve the same results
