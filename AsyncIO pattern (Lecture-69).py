"""

Asynchronous I/O, or async for short, is a programming pattern that allows for high-performance I/O operations in a concurrent and non-blocking manner.
In Python, async programming is achieved through the use of the asyncio module and asynchronous functions.

Async IO is a powerful programming pattern that allows for high-performance and concurrent I/O operations in Python.
With the asyncio module and asynchronous functions, you can write efficient and scalable code that can handle
large amounts of data and I/O operations without blocking the main thread. Whether you're working on web applications,
network services, or data processing pipelines, async IO is an essential tool for any Python developer.
